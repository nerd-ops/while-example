# @elx_rip

# okay ,let's go

# how we can make a "while" loop?

# okay ,this question is too easy :3
# first, what we can say of this loop?
# It is infinite but we can give it an end
#-------------------------------------------------------------
while True: # this loop don't have a final
  # ur code
  pass
while True:
  break # this word break the "while" loop
while True:
  continue # It is used to return to the beginning of the loop at any time, without executing the lines below the wor
#--------------------------------------------------------------
# we can use conditions for "while"
number = 90
while number < 100: # in this case the code finish when number is greater than 100
  number+=1
# the "<" indicates the condition in which this loop is executed
